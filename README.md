Pikachu Volleyball

This is a game made as part of the project for EECE 259, Introduction to Microcomputers.

This program is used with an Altera DE1 board. If uploaded correctly via Altera's Quartus program, the DE1 board should output the game screen via VGA, such as to a computer monitor. No sound was implemented. 

A brief demo is shown here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J3gdZ2oWGE
